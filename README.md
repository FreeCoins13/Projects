# Projects
These are some of the projects we had at Tech Elevator.
The Vending machine capstone project was completed after 4 weeks of Java. 
Instructor Feedback: It still needs significant refactoring before it is truly readable, and there is some repetion with the Interface (should have used a super class!).

Two weeks later, we completed the capstone project National Park Reservation System. This project required integration with SQL postgres databases, and I was able to apply some of the suggestions from the feedback provided for the vending machine by breaking down the methods in the CLI into smaller methods that are easier to follow.
Instructor Feedback: I ended up using recursive methods, not realizing that this causes there to be multiple sessions running at once that will eventually result in a crash. A better way to handle "return to previous menu" is to use while loops.
