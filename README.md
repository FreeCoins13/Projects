# Projects
These are the capstone projects we had at Tech Elevator
The Vending machine project was completed after 4 weeks of Java. It still needs some refactoring before it is truly readable,
and there is some repition with the Interface (should have used a super class!)
Two weeks later, we completed the National Park Reservation System. This project require integration with SQL postgres databases.
