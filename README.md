# Projects
These are some of the projects we had at Tech Elevator.
The Vending machine capstone project was completed after 4 weeks of Java. It still needs some refactoring before it is truly readable, and there is some repetion with the Interface (should have used a super class!).

Two weeks later, we completed the capstone project National Park Reservation System. This project required integration with SQL postgres databases, and I was able to apply some of the suggestions from the feedback provided for the vending machine by breaking down the methods in the CLI into smaller methods that are easier to follow.
